    "The TuneSifter digs up your top artists and tracks on Spotify and hands you a beautful curated recommendations playlist",
    "If you're like me you don't have the time to make playlists and spotify's shuffle is terrible, so this curates flavorful playlists.",

    "Also a Spotify-wide search will not be implemented, the tunesifter is for your top tracks and artists, personal and magic to you."
